# Bee

Bee is a library that enables devices (commonly Arduino) to communicate with
other devices using human-readable [RESP][1] encoded messages over different
user-implemented communication channels such as serial port, bluetooth or
Wi-Fi.

Bee could be awesome if you're willing to give up from 16 (average) up to 256
bytes of precious RAM only for exchanging messages, that could be the case for
devices with simple sensors that just need to report sensor data to another
device that is going to interprete them (see [Hive][3]).

If you're looking for a more mature (and not human-readable) protocol you
should try [Firmata][2] first.

## How to install (on Arduino)

Download the latest [.ZIP package][4] and follow the official instructions on
[importing a .ZIP library][5].
